              <h3>Improving Context-Aware Semantic Relationships in Sparse Mobile Datasets</h3>
              <p class="date">Sep - Dec 2018</p>
              <p>When entering pieces of text on mobile devices, whether they be tweets, messages, or search queries, the device is often capable of passively recording much more information about the context of that piece of text than simply the text itself. Hence, my team explored various ways to incorporate multimodal features — such as date, time, location, weather, accelerometer, or records of past entries — in order to improve the semantic and contextual salience of pieces of text. The ultimate goal of our work is to create more semantically accurate idea discovery; most notably, our work may be applied as a powerful technique for research discovery.</p>

              <h3>Biophysically-Realistic Model of Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus</h3>
              <p class="date">Sep 2018 - Present</p>
              <p>As a researcher in the Computational Modeling group of the Soltesz Lab in the Stanford Medicine Department of Neurosurgery, I am working to construct a biophysically-realistic network model of the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus. Once complete, this model would allow for rapid testing and discovery of new potential avenues for further experimentation within the hippocampus, and would hopefully pave the way for a full-scale biophysically-realistic model of the brain in the future. </p>

              <p>My team developed a mobile platform concept for collaborative knowledge management for journalists. The application allows members of an organization to discover members with similar interests and projects based on elements they enter into their personal cache.</p>

            <h3>Virtualitics IPython-C# API for Advanced Data Analytics</h3>
              <p class="date">Jun - Sep 2018</p>
              <p>At Virtualitics, I spearheaded and developed an API to enable the Virtualitics platform — a VR-enabled data visualization platform primarily for business consumers — to interface with advanced data analytic frameworks like IPython. This API is now built into the software to allow data scientists to seamlessly integrate traditional data analytics with Virtualitics’ high-dimensional visualization. The API is also used internally for rapid large-scale robustness testing, error discovery, parameter tuning, and general quality assurance.</p>

                <h3>Efficient PCA-Based Anomaly Detection</h3>
                <p class="date">Jun - Sep 2018</p>
                <p>At Virtualitics, I developed an efficient PCA-based anomaly detection algorithm. In practice, the algorithm is used for efficient discovery of outliers conforming to the topology of the dataset, with applications in fraud detection, network intrusion detection, and data cleaning.</p>

                <h3>Modifying the AttnGAN Discriminator for Improved Feature-Specific Text-to-Image Synthesis</h3>
                <p class="date">Mar - Jun 2018</p>
                <p>In this project, we explored the modification of the Attentional Generative Adversarial Network (AttnGAN) model for text-to-image synthesis. We modified the three-branch AttnGAN framework by implementing spectral normalization to stabilize the training of the discriminator and found that spectral normalization improves the inception score of generated images when applied only to the first branch by increasing the stability of training of the original AttnGAN model.</p>

                <h3>Low‐Cost, Portable Paper‐Based Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease: Targeting Aβ Oligomers in the Brain Using Polymeric Nanoconjugates as Artificial Biomarkers</h3>
                <p class="date">Sep 2016 - Jun 2017</p>
                <p>As the most common neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease affects over 35 million people around the world, two‐thirds of whom reside in developing countries. I developed a low-cost, efficient, paper-based colorimetric urine dipstick test for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The device was recognized at an international sustainability conference, and by leading Alzheimer's researchers at Duke University for potential in clinical trials and commercialization.</p>

                <h3>Portable, Low-Cost Tattoo-Based Biosensor for the Non-Invasive Self-Diagnosis and Quantification of Atherosclerosis</h3>
                <p class="date">Sep 2015 - Jun 2016</p>
                <p>Atherosclerosis causes nearly one-third of all deaths in the world, 80% of which occurs in developing countries. Unfortunately, atherosclerosis commonly remains asymptomatic for decades, and no cost-effective means of diagnosis currently exist. In this work, I developed a low-cost, portable, self-administered tattoo-based biosensor for the diagnosis and quantification of atherosclerosis. As a result, I presented the work at the Stockholm International Youth Science Seminar (SIYSS) and the 2017 Nobel Prize ceremony and gala.</p>

                <h3>Hybridized Manganese Dioxide &#38; Gold-Iron Oxide Nanoparticle Inhibition of Tumor Growth via Radiosensitization and Tumor Microenvironment Control</h3>
                <p class="date">Sep 2014 - Jun 2015</p>
                <p>Controlled bombardment of cancer cells via ionizing radiation remains the leading form of cancer treatment. However, radiation treatment is often avoided because of its ineffectiveness and damage caused to neighboring, healthy tissue. This work details the development of a nanocluster-based therapy to be administered routinely throughout a standard treatment cycle, which works effectively to target and tumor cells and mitigte tumor aggressiveness.</p>
